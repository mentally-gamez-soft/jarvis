This document will define the rules for the "agent-triage" agent, which is responsible for polling emails and translating the requirements found in the emails into an epic that will be a markdown structured document stored on a S3 bucket. This agent will be able to understand the requirements and translate them into a structured epic that will be used as a reference for the development team to understand the scope and goals of the project. It will also be responsible for continuously updating and refining the epic document as the project evolves and new requirements emerge, ensuring that it remains a living document that accurately represents the current state of the project and its objectives. Additionally, it will ensure that any updates to the epic are properly documented and communicated to the relevant team members to maintain alignment and clarity throughout the development process.

# Emails formatting rules
1. The subject of the email should start with the prefix "[JARVIS]-[PROJECT_TITLE]" (where [PROJECT_TITLE] will be the title of the project) to ensure that the agent can easily identify and filter the relevant emails for processing. This prefix will help the agent to distinguish between emails that are intended for the agent and other emails that may be unrelated to the project. By using a consistent subject prefix, the agent can efficiently poll the email inbox and focus on processing only the relevant emails that contain requirements for the project. This will help to streamline the workflow and ensure that the agent can effectively manage and translate the requirements into a structured epic document without being overwhelmed by irrelevant emails.
2. The body of the email can contain the following:
  - mandatory: a tag [title] and under it the title of the project, which should be a concise and descriptive name that captures the essence of the project and its main objectives. The title should be clear and informative, providing a quick overview of what the project is about and what it aims to achieve. This will help the agent to quickly understand the context and focus of the project when processing the email and translating the requirements into an epic document.
  - mandatory: a tag [idea] followed by a detailed description of the idea, which should provide a comprehensive overview of the concept, features, and functionalities that are envisioned for the project. The description should be clear and detailed, outlining the key aspects of the idea and how it addresses the needs or problems that the project aims to solve. This will help the agent to understand the requirements and translate them into a structured epic document that accurately reflects the vision and goals of the project.
  - optional: a tag [envs] followed by a list of environment variables that are required for the project, along with their descriptions and any relevant details about how they should be configured. This information will help the agent to understand the technical requirements of the project and ensure that the epic document includes any necessary details about the environment variables that are needed for the development and deployment of the project. All those environement variables should be then translated as the equivalent of '.env' file but in the requirements document, in the end the agent "agent-scrum-master" will translate it to a ".env" file later on. Additionally, any changes to the environment variables should be reflected in the README.md file  and in the ".env" file to ensure that it remains up to date and accurate as the project evolves.
  - optional: a tag [directives] followed by a list of technicla instructions that could be required for the project, along with their descriptions and any relevant details about how they should be used in the project. This information will help the agent to understand the technical requirements of the project and ensure that the epic document includes any necessary details about the dependencies that are needed for the development of the project. 
  Those instructions could be: 
    1. dependencies 
    2. technical frameworks to be used
    3. coding standards to be followed
    4. architectural patterns to be implemented
    5. specific tools or technologies that should be used in the project
    6. any other technical requirements or guidelines that are relevant to the project and that should be followed by the development team during the implementation of the project.
  At the end of the journey (i.e when "agent-developer" will work), all those instructions should be then translated technically into dependencies to add in 'requirements.txt' or technical framework that should be used etc. 

# Example of email format
Subject: [JARVIS]-[Project Phoenix]
Body:
[title]
Project Phoenix
[idea]
Project Phoenix is a web application that allows users to track their fitness goals and progress. The application will provide features such as workout tracking, nutrition logging, and progress visualization. Users will be able to set fitness goals, create workout plans, and log their daily activities to monitor their progress over time. The application will also include a social component, allowing users to connect with friends, share their achievements, and participate in fitness challenges. The goal of Project Phoenix is to help users stay motivated and accountable in their fitness journey, and to provide them with the tools and resources they need to achieve their health and fitness goals.
[envs]
DATABASE_URL: the URL of the database that will be used to store user data and application information
SECRET_KEY: a secret key that will be used for securing the application and managing user sessions
[directives]
- The application should be built using the Django web framework and should follow the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern.
- The code should adhere to the PEP 8 coding standards for Python, and the development team should use Git for version control, following a branching strategy that includes feature branches, a development branch, and a main branch for production releases. Additionally, the application should be containerized using Docker, and the development team should follow best practices for containerization to ensure that the resulting Docker images are efficient, secure, and easy to deploy. The application should also include comprehensive unit tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the code, and the development team should follow best practices for writing effective and maintainable unit tests. Finally, the application should be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future growth and the addition of new features as needed, while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase that can be easily understood and modified by the development team.
