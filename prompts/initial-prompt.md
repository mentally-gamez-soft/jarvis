This Jarvis project is aiming at creating a set of Agents that can be used to manage software projects, and auto-implement features based on a quick draft of requirements provided by the user. 
The agents will be able to:
 - manage the project: create new projects, create user stories and tasks, prioritize them, and track their progress using Trello.
 - write code
 - write and execute the tests
 - handle the data model of the application. 
 
The agents will be able to follow their own set of rules that are defined in the `rules/<agent-name>/` directory, and they will be able to adapt to different projects and requirements based on these rules.

The Jarvis project will rely on 4 agents:
1. Agent 1, named "agent-triage", will be responsible for polling emails and translate the requirements found in the emails into an epic that will be a markdown structured document stored on a S3 bucket. This agent is completely described in `agent-triage-requirements.md` file. It will be able to understand the requirements and translate them into a structured epic that will be used as a reference for the development team to understand the scope and goals of the project. It will also be responsible for continuously updating and refining the epic document as the project evolves and new requirements emerge, ensuring that it remains a living document that accurately represents the current state of the project and its objectives. Additionally, it will ensure that any updates to the epic are properly documented and communicated to the relevant team members to maintain alignment and clarity throughout the development process.

2. Agent 2: named "agent-scrum-master", will be responsible for managing the project, the user stories and the tasks. It will poll the epic from the S3 bucket, break it down into user stories and tasks, and create the corresponding Trello cards for each user story and task. Simultaneously, it will create md files for the user-stories and the tasks in the respctive folders of the project `DOCUMENTATION/USER_STORIES/user_story_<id>.md` and `DOCUMENTATION/TASKS/task_<user-story-id>_<task-id>.md` where <user-story-id> is the id of the user-story and <task-id> is the id of the task. 
It will also be responsible for updating the Trello board as the work progresses, and for ensuring that the team is following the defined processes and that any issues or blockers are addressed promptly. It will follow the rules defined in the `rules/agent-scrum-master/project-management-rules.md` file.
As a scrum master this agent will be able to understand the requirements and break them down into user stories and tasks, and it will be able to prioritize them based on the urgency and importance of the requirements. It will also be responsible for creating the corresponding Trello cards for each user story and task, and for updating the Trello board as the work progresses.

3. Agent 3: named "agent-developer", will be responsible for writing the code and the tests, and for handling the data model of the application. It will follow the rules defined in:
 - `rules/agent-developer/git-branching-rules.md` file for managing the git branches 
 - `rules/agent-developer/models-rules.md` file for handling the data model
 - `rules/agent-developer/unit-tests-rules.md` file for writing the tests
 - `rules/agent-developer/containerization-rules.md` file for containerization best practices
It will also be responsible for writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code that follows best practices and coding standards. It will be able to understand the requirements and implement the features accordingly, and it will be able to write comprehensive tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.
This agent will also be responsible for the data model of the application, ensuring that any changes to the data model are properly managed and that database migrations are handled correctly across different environments. It will follow the rules defined in the `rules/agent-developer/models-rules.md` file to ensure that the data model is well-designed, scalable, and maintainable.
This agent will also be responsible for writing comprehensive tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the application. It will follow the rules defined in the `rules/agent-developer/unit-tests-rules.md` file to ensure that the unit tests are effective, maintainable, and provide value in terms of verifying the correctness of the code and preventing regressions.
This agent will also be responsible for containerizing the application using Docker, and it will follow the rules defined in the `rules/agent-developer/containerization-rules.md` file to ensure that the containerization is done following best practices and that the resulting Docker images are efficient, secure, and easy to deploy.
Once the implementation of a feature is done, this agent will create a pull request for the corresponding branch, and it will be responsible for addressing any feedback provided by the reviewers during the code review process.


# CONSTRAINTS
- This project involves the creation of multiple agents that will work together to manage software projects and implement features based on user requirements. Each agent has its own set of rules that it must follow, and these rules are defined in the `rules/<agent-name>/` directory. The agents will need to be able to communicate and collaborate effectively to ensure that the project is managed efficiently and that the features are implemented correctly.
- The agents will need to be able to adapt to different projects and requirements based on the rules defined for each agent. This means that the agents will need to be flexible and able to handle a wide range of scenarios and requirements, while still adhering to the constraints and guidelines defined in their respective rules files.
- Each agent is a separate project in itself, and it will need to be developed and tested independently before being integrated into the overall Jarvis project. This means that each agent will need to have its own codebase, tests, and documentation, and it will need to be developed following best practices for software development to ensure that it is maintainable, scalable, and reliable. And most of all each agent will need its own python virtual environment to ensure that the dependencies are properly managed and that there are no conflicts between the different agents. Each agent will have its own `requirements.in` file for managing its dependencies, and a `requirements.txt` file will be generated from the `requirements.in` file using `uv lock` command. This approach ensures that the dependencies for each agent are properly managed and that the project remains consistent across different environments. Additionally, any new dependencies added to an agent should be documented in the `README.md` file of that agent, along with a brief description of their purpose and how they are used in the agent. This documentation will help other developers understand the dependencies and their role in the agent, making it easier for them to contribute effectively to the development of each agent.
- Each agent will have its own `.env` file for managing its environment variables, and these environment variables should be properly documented in the `README.md` file of each agent. This documentation should include a clear description of each environment variable, its purpose, and any relevant details about how it is used in the agent. This approach ensures that the environment variables are properly managed and that other developers can easily understand their role in the agent and how to set them up correctly when working on the project. Additionally, any changes to the environment variables should be reflected in the `README.md` file to ensure that it remains up to date and accurate as the project evolves.
